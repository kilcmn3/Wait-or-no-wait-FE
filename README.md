# Known Bugs

- The list of all waitlist customers disappear due to  set-time interval function. 
- add-customer: adding quoted time can only added by add-button not by typing.
- Reservation: add functionality on 'confirm' button.(currently it doesn't do anything)

# Improvements

- More authentication logic (Currently there is no validation for login/signup)
- Instead using css-bootstrap, trying without any bootstarp 
- set-time interval fucntion.(Better way to setup functtion.)
